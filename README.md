**UI/UX Course Journey**

“My learning journey and design projects from the Udemy UI/UX course.”

Welcome to my **UI/UX Learning Repository**!  
I’m currently studying a UI/UX course on Udemy, and this repo is where I’ll **share my progress, notes, sketches, and projects**.  

📌 What you’ll find here
- 📝 Study notes from each section (Sketching, Inspiration, Figma, User Flows, Sitemaps…)
- 🎯 Hands-on projects (logos, buttons, responsive layouts, etc.)
- 🖼️ Assets and design experiments
- 📚 Templates for study logs and case studies

✨ Why this repo?
This repo is not just for tracking progress — it’s also my design journal.  
I want to document what I learn, what I create, and how I improve over time.

Stay tuned as I keep updating my journey! 🚀
